    |
    | `encrypt` binds the kit's EncryptedConversationStore over laravel/ai's
    | ConversationStore contract: message content is encrypted with the app
    | key before it touches the database, and pre-encryption plaintext rows
    | still read back. It is ON BY DEFAULT (owner decision, DECISIONS.md #8)
    | with per-app opt-out, and every row written while it is on passes a
    | one-way door: those rows are readable only through this store and only
    | with the app key that wrote them. Keep the key, and do not flip the
    | toggle back and forth. Opting out leaves the vendor store bound (or
    | bind your own). Table names and the connection follow the vendor keys
    | (`ai.conversations.tables.*`, `ai.conversations.connection`).
    |
    | `persist_tool_traces` keeps attachments / tool_calls / tool_results /
    | meta / the approval pause marker on message rows — ENCRYPTED by the
    | store above (usage stays plaintext: aggregate numbers, no user
    | content). ON by default per owner decision DECISIONS.md #7 (traces
    | persist encrypted with short retention); laravel/ai's Approvable
    | pause/resume — the kit's classified approval seam — reconstructs
    | paused turns from these traces, so turning this off also disables
    | resumable approvals. `trace_retention_days` is the SEPARATE short
    | window (#7: 7–30d) beyond which `ai-kit:prune-conversations` strips
    | traces from old rows while the conversation itself lives on.

    | `retention_days` is the idle window `ai-kit:prune-conversations`
    | deletes beyond (the --days option overrides per run). Retention is

    | delete pass a warning no-op, so only apps that set a window (e.g.
    | uqucc's ~90 days for anonymous threads) ever delete anything. The
    | command fires a ConversationsPruning event with the doomed ids first,

    | materializes from this same file (the reviewed config stays the source
    | of truth — the table adds enable/disable ops control and app metadata).

    | model per declared task), `provider_max_price` ({prompt, completion}
